# HAVEN

HAVEN (High Availability Vault for Events on Nostr) is the most sovereign personal relay for the Nostr protocol, for storing and backing up sensitive notes like eCash, private chats and drafts. It is a relay that is not so dumb, with features like web of trust, inbox relay, cloud backups, blastr and the ability to import old notes. It even includes it's own blossom media server!

## Four Relays in One + Blossom Media Server

**Private Relay**: This relay is only accessible by the owner of the relay. It is used for drafts, ecash and other private notes that nobody can read or write to. It is protected by Auth.

**Chat Relay**: This relay is used to contact the owner by DM. Only people in the web of trust can interact with this relay, protected by Auth. It only accepts encrypted DMs and group chat kinds.

**Inbox Relay**: This relay is where the owner of the relay reads from. Send your zaps, reactions and replies to this relay when you're tagging the owner. You can also pull notes from this relay if you want notes where the owner is tagged. This relay automatically pulls notes from other relays. Only notes where the owner is tagged will be accepted to this relay.

**Outbox Relay**: This relay is where the owner's notes all live and are publicly accessible. You can import all your old notes to this relay. All notes sent to this relay are blasted to other relays. Only the owner can send to this relay, but anyone can read.

**Blossom Media Server**: This relay also includes a media server for hosting images and videos. You can upload images and videos to this relay and get a link to share them. Only the relay owner can upload to this relay, but anyone can view the images and videos.

## Not So Dumb Relay Features

**Web of Trust**: Protected from DM and Inbox spam by using a web of trust.

**Inbox Relay**: Notes are pulled from other relays and stored in the inbox relay.

**Cloud Backups**: Notes are backed up in the cloud and can be restored if the relay is lost.

**Blastr**: Notes sent to the outbox are also blasted to other relays.

**Import Old Notes**: Import your old notes and notes you're tagged in from other relays.

## Prerequisites

- **Go**: Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

    ```bash
    sudo apt update #Update Package List
    sudo apt install snapd #install snapd to get a newer version of Go
    sudo snap install go --classic #Install Go
    go version #check if go was installed correctly
    ```

- **Build Essentials**: If you're using Linux, you may need to install build essentials. You can do this by running `sudo apt install build-essential`.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the Haven Relay running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitvora/haven.git
cd haven
```

### 2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

You'll need to create an `.env` file based on the example provided in the repository.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Set your environment variables

Open the `.env` file and set the necessary environment variables.

### 4. Create the relays JSON files

Copy the example relays JSON files for your seed and blastr relays:

```bash
cp relays_import.example.json relays_import.json
```

```bash
cp relays_blastr.example.json relays_blastr.json
```

The JSON should contain an array of relay URLs, which default to wss:// if you don't explicitly specify the protocol.

### 4. Build the project

Run the following command to build the relay:

```bash
go build
```

### 5. Create a Systemd Service

To have the relay run as a service, create a systemd unit file. Make sure to limit the memory usage to less than your system's total memory to prevent the relay from crashing the system.
and Replace the values for `ExecStart` and `WorkingDirectory` with the actual paths where you cloned the repository and stored the `.env` file.


1. Create the file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/haven.service
```

2. Add the following contents:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Haven Relay
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/haven/haven #Edit path to point to the path of where the haven git was pulled
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/haven #Edit path to point to the path of where the haven git was pulled
MemoryLimit=1000M  # Example, Limit memory usage to 1000 MB | Edit this to fit your machine
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```


3. Reload systemd to recognize the new service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

4. Start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start haven
```

5. (Optional) Enable the service to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable haven
```

### 6. Serving over nginx (optional)

To have a domain name (example: relay.domain.com) point to your machine, you will need to setup an nginx.

1. Install nginx on your relay:

```bash
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

2. Remove default config: `sudo rm -rf /etc/nginx/sites-available/default`

3. Create new default config: `sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default` 

4. Add new reverse proxy config by adding the following configuration to your nginx configuration file:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    client_max_body_size 100m;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3355;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
}
```

Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name.

> [!NOTE]
> [`client_max_body_size`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size) is set to 100m
> to allow for larger media files to be uploaded to Blossom. `0` can be used to allow for unlimited file sizes. If you are 
> using Cloudflare proxy, be mindful of [upload limits](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/maximum-upload-size-is-limit/418490/2).

After adding the configuration, restart nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Alternative: Serving over Caddy
<details><summary>Click here to view the installation routine for Caddy</summary>
<p>

Preparation: Set the A record (for your domain) to point to the server's IP address.

1. Install caddy:

```bash
sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install caddy
```

2. Open Caddyfile:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

3. Add configuration:

```bash
# Configuration for HAVEN Relay
yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3355 {
        header_up Host {host}
        header_up X-Real-IP {remote_host}
        header_up X-Forwarded-For {remote_host}
        header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme}
        transport http {
            versions 1.1
        }
    }
    request_body {
        max_size 100MB
    }
}
```

4. Reload Caddy:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

5. Check status logs:

```bash
sudo systemctl status caddy
sudo journalctl -u caddy -f --since "2 hour ago"
```

**Note:** Caddy automatically manages certificates and WebSocket connections. Certbot is not required.

</p>
</details>

### 7. Install Certbot (optional)

If you want to serve the relay over HTTPS, you can use Certbot to generate an SSL certificate.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

After installing Certbot, run the following command to generate an SSL certificate:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx
```

Follow the instructions to generate the certificate.

Note: Command will fail if the Domain you added to nginx is not yet pointing at your machine's IP address. 
This is done by adding an A record subdomain pointing to your IP address through your DNS recrods Manager.

### 8. Run The Import (optional)

If you want to import your old notes and notes you're tagged in from other relays, run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop haven
./haven --import
sudo systemctl start haven
```

### 9. Access the relay

Once everything is set up, the relay will be running on `localhost:3355` with the following endpoints:

- `localhost:3355` (outbox and Blossom server)
- `localhost:3355/private`
- `localhost:3355/chat`
- `localhost:3355/inbox`

## Start the Project with Docker Compose

To start the project using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure the `.env` file is present in the project directory and has the necessary environment variables set.
4. You'll also need to expose ports 80 and 443 to the internet and set up your DNS A and AAAA (if you are using IPv6)
   records to point to your server's IP address.
5. (Optional) You can also change the paths of the `blossom`, `db`, and `templates` folders in the `compose.yml` file.

   ```yaml
   volumes:
      - ./blossom:/haven/blossom # only change the left side before the colon
      - ./db:/haven/db
      - ./templates:/haven/templates
   ```
6. (Optional) Nginx is pre-configured to reject uploads larger than 100MB. If you want to change this, modify the `client_max_body_size`
directive in the `nginx/haven_proxy.conf file`.

   ```nginx
   client_max_body_size 0;
   ```

7. Run the following command:

   ```sh
   # in foreground
   docker compose up --build
   # in background
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```
   
8. For updating the relay, run the following commands:

   ```sh
   git pull
   docker compose down
   docker compose build
   # in foreground
   docker compose up
   # in background
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Database

Haven currently supports [BadgerDB](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) and [LMDB](https://www.symas.com/mdb) as embedded
databases, meaning no external database is required.

By default, Haven uses BadgerDB. To switch to LMDB, set the `DB_ENGINE` environment variable to `lmdb` in the `.env` file.

LMDB can be faster than BadgerDB but performs best with NVMe drives and may require fine-tuning based on factors such as
database size, operating system, file system, and hardware.

### LMDB Map Size

There is no one-size-fits-all value for LMDB’s map size. Windows and macOS users, in particular, may need
to adjust the `LMDB_MAPSIZE` environment variable to a value lower than the available free disk space if the default
value of 273 GB is too high. Otherwise, Haven will fail to bootstrap. Users with large databases may also need to
increase the `LMDB_MAPSIZE` value above the default. On most systems, the default value should work fine.

Despite the large default value, on most modern systems LMDB will only use the disk space it needs. The map size simply
defines an upper limit for the database size. For more information about LMDB’s map size, refer to the
[LMDB documentation](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/group__mdb.html#gaa2506ec8dab3d969b0e609cd82e619e5).

### Migrating from databases created in older versions of Haven

Haven versions 1.0.3 and earlier did not replace outdated notes. While this does not impact the relay's core 
functionality, it can lead to a bloated database, reduced performance, and bugs in certain clients. For this reason, it
is recommended to delete old databases and start fresh, optionally [re-importing](#8-run-the-import-optional) previous notes.

## Blossom Media Server

The outbox relay also functions as a media server for hosting images and videos. You can upload media files to the relay and obtain a shareable link.  
Only the relay owner has upload permissions to the media server, but anyone can view the hosted images and videos.

Media files are stored in the file system based on the `BLOSSOM_PATH` environment variable set in the `.env` file. The default path is `./blossom`.

## Cloud Backups

The relay automatically backs up your database to a cloud provider of your choice.

### S3-Compatible Object Storage

To back up your database to S3 compatible storage such as [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), 
[GCP Cloud Storage] or 
[DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces).

First need to create the bucket on your provider. After creating the Bucket you will be provided with:

- Access Key ID
- Secret Key
- URL Endpoint
- Region
- Bucket Name

Once you have this data, update your `.env` file with the appropriate information:

```Dotenv
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key_id"
S3_SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"
S3_ENDPOINT="your_endpoint"
S3_REGION="your_region"
S3_BUCKET_NAME="your_bucket"
```

Replace `your_access_key_id`, `your_secret_access_key`, `your_region`, and `your_bucket` with your actual credentials.

You may also want to set the `BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS` environment variable to specify how often the relay should back up 
the database.

```Dotenv
BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS=24
```

Finally, you need to specifiy `s3` as the backup provider:

```Dotenv
BACKUP_PROVIDER="s3" # s3, none (or leave blank to disable)
```

#### AWS S3

For AWS S3, set the appropriate endpoint for your region/availability zone:

```Dotenv
S3_ACCESS_KEY="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
S3_SECRET_KEY="wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
S3_ENDPOINT="s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com""
S3_REGION="us-east-1"
S3_BUCKET_NAME="haven_backup"
```

#### GCP Cloud Storage

For GCP, you can set `S3_ENDPOINT` to `storage.googleapis.com`. 

`S3_REGION` can be left blank. `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `S3_SECRET_KEY` needs to be set to a [HMAC key](
https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/hmackeys), see GCP's official documentation on [how to create a HMAC 
key for a service account](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/managing-hmackeys#create).

```Dotenv
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="GOOGXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
S3_SECRET_KEY="Yyy+YYY0/yYYYYyyyy0+YyyYyyYyyYyyyyYyyYyy"
S3_ENDPOINT="storage.googleapis.com"
S3_REGION=""
S3_BUCKET_NAME="haven_backup"
```

#### DigitalOcean Spaces

To back up your database to DigitalOcean Spaces, you'll first need to create a bucket in the DigitalOcean dashboard.
This can be done in the "Spaces Object Storage" tab or by visiting https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces.

Once you have created a bucket you will be shown an access key ID and a secret key. Additionally,
while creating the bucket you will have selected a region to host this bucket which has a URL. For example,
if you choose the datacenter region "Amsterdam - Datacenter 3 - AMS3", your region will be `ams3` and
the endpoint will be `ams3.digitalocean.com`.

### Deprecation warning

The old `aws` and `gcp` backup providers have been deprecated in favor of the new `s3` provider. If you are using the
old providers, please update your `.env` file to use the new `s3` provider. The old providers will be removed in a future
release.
